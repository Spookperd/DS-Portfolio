# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository showcases various data science skills and techniques I have learned and applied to real-world datasets. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my expertise in different areas of data science and machine learning.

## Skills Showcased

1. **SQL**: Querying, filtering, sorting, and aggregating data using SQL on a dataset of San Francisco salaries.
2. **Data Processing/Wrangling**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering on the Titanic dataset.
3. **Visualization**: Creating insightful visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn on the World Happiness Report dataset.
4. **Regression**: Predicting house prices using linear regression and decision tree regression on the House Prices dataset.
5. **Classification**: Classifying Iris species using logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest classifiers on the Iris dataset.
6. **Clustering**: Performing customer segmentation using K-means clustering on the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset.
7. **Deep Learning**: Building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
